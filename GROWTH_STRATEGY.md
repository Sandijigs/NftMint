4. **Respond Fast**: Reply within 1 hour to all questions

5. **Be Authentic**: Share both wins AND challenges

6. **Iterate Quickly**: If something isn't working by Day 3, change it

7. **Celebrate Users**: Make them the heroes, not your product

8. **Document Journey**: BTS content performs well in crypto

9. **Cross-Pollinate**: Share Farcaster posts on Twitter, vice versa

10. **Stay Consistent**: Daily rhythm is YOUR streak too

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Low Initial Traction

**If <20 users by Day 3**:

- Post in more channels (DeFi, NFT communities)

### Technical Issues

**If contract bug found**:

- Pause immediately
- Communicate transparently
- Deploy fix ASAP
- Compensate affected users

### Community Negativity

**If negative sentiment**:

- Address concerns directly
- Don't be defensive
- Over-communicate
- Show you're listening with quick changes
